#Sentimental Analysis

Sentiment analysis for mental health monitoring involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning to assess the emotional tone present in sources. By categorizing statements as positive, negative, or neutral, these systems help in identifying mood patterns, emotional distress, or signs of mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Monitoring these sentiments over time can enable early detection of mental health risks and inform timely intervention strategies for individuals. This approach offers a scalable, non- invasive way to support mental health care by providing valuable data-driven insights to clinicians and policymakers.
